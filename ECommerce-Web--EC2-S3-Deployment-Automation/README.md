# Terraform-Automation-Projects: E-Commerce Web EC2 & S3 Deployment Automation

## Overview

This project demonstrates the automation of deploying an E-Commerce website using Terraform on AWS. The infrastructure is designed to be scalable, secure, and easily manageable. By leveraging Terraform, the entire deployment process is codified, ensuring consistency and repeatability across environments.

## VPC with Servers in Private Subnets and NAT
In this project, I followed best practices for deploying a secure and resilient infrastructure in AWS by creating a VPC with servers in private subnets. The architecture ensures high availability by deploying resources across two Availability Zones (AZs), utilizing an Auto Scaling group for dynamic instance management and an Application Load Balancer to evenly distribute traffic.

### Key Features:
Private Subnets with NAT Gateway: Servers are deployed in private subnets for enhanced security, with NAT Gateways in each AZ to allow instances to connect to the internet for updates and patches.
Public Subnets: NAT Gateways and Load Balancer nodes are deployed in public subnets, providing the necessary connectivity while keeping backend instances secure.
Resilient Routing: The route tables are configured to direct traffic efficiently, with local routes within the VPC and routes to the Internet Gateway (IGW) and NAT Gateway for external communications.
Auto Scaling & Load Balancing: EC2 instances are managed by Auto Scaling, ensuring the application remains responsive under varying load conditions. The Application Load Balancer manages inbound traffic, distributing requests to instances across AZs.
This setup is ideal for production environments, offering scalability, security, and fault tolerance.

## Project Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:

```
.
├── E-Commerce-Website/       # Directory containing the website files
├── .gitignore                # Git ignore file to exclude unnecessary files
├── .terraform.lock.hcl       # Terraform lock file for dependency management
├── main.tf                   # Main Terraform configuration file
├── provider.tf               # Terraform provider configuration
├── terraform.tfstate         # Terraform state file
├── terraform.tfstate.backup  # Backup of the Terraform state file
├── user_data1.sh             # User data script for EC2 instance 1
└── user_data2.sh             # User data script for EC2 instance 2
```

## Components

### 1. **E-Commerce Website**
   - This directory contains the code and assets for the E-Commerce website that will be hosted on EC2 instances.

### 2. **main.tf**
   - This is the main Terraform configuration file that defines the infrastructure resources. It includes the creation of VPC, subnets, internet gateway, route tables, security groups, EC2 instances, and S3 buckets.

### 3. **provider.tf**
   - This file specifies the AWS provider and its configurations, such as the region where the resources will be deployed.

### 4. **user_data1.sh & user_data2.sh**
   - These are shell scripts that configure the EC2 instances during the boot process. They install necessary software and deploy the E-Commerce website onto the instances.

### 5. **terraform.tfstate & terraform.tfstate.backup**
   - These files keep track of the current state of the infrastructure, helping Terraform manage the resources it creates.

## Deployment Steps

### 1. **Initialize the Project**

Before you start, ensure that Terraform is installed on your machine. Then, navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
terraform init
```

This command initializes the project and downloads the necessary provider plugins.

### 2. **Review and Customize Configuration**

Open the `main.tf` and `provider.tf` files to review the configuration. You can customize variables like instance types, region, and AMI IDs according to your needs.

### 3. **Plan the Infrastructure**

To preview the changes that Terraform will apply, run:

```bash
terraform plan
```

This command generates an execution plan, showing you what resources will be created, modified, or destroyed.

### 4. **Deploy the Infrastructure**

Once you're satisfied with the plan, apply the changes to deploy the infrastructure:

```bash
terraform apply
```

Type `yes` when prompted to confirm the changes. Terraform will create all the resources defined in the configuration files.

### 5. **Access the E-Commerce Website**

After the infrastructure is deployed, you can access the E-Commerce website using the public IPs of the EC2 instances. These IPs can be found in the output of the `terraform apply` command or in the AWS Management Console.

### 6. **Clean Up Resources**

When you are done with the deployment, you can destroy all the resources to avoid incurring unnecessary costs:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

Type `yes` when prompted, and Terraform will tear down the entire infrastructure.



## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Insufficient Permissions**: Ensure your AWS credentials have sufficient permissions to create resources.
2. **Terraform State Issues**: If Terraform fails to apply changes, it may be due to an inconsistent state. You can manually inspect and fix the `terraform.tfstate` file if necessary.

### Tips:

- Use Terraform workspaces if managing multiple environments.
- Regularly update the `.terraform.lock.hcl` file to keep dependencies up-to-date.

## Conclusion

This project provides a simple yet effective way to automate the deployment of an E-Commerce website on AWS using Terraform. By following Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles, the deployment is reliable, repeatable, and scalable.
